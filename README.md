#TriShoot V1.4.0 Release - 11.12.2025

Its here!
I worked straight the past few days so i can finally have a working TriShoot at my Hands and this is what it gives you:

This Version contains everything the 1.3 Release does except following things:

Working Fullscreen Toggle (Currently not Implemented im Sorry)
Highscore Save and Loading
Known Bugs:
Highscore currently not Displaying correctly when in Game Over (I am sorry but currently i am just to tired to do that simple fix it was a long day lol)

I will try to be extending the Development of TriShoot with the knowledge i will gain throughout the Years.
Currently i am trying to focus this and following Updates to ONLY my own Knowledge which i am fully understanding instead of 5m AI / Google search and Copy / Pasting the code. This wont make me a better Programmer.

Whats so special about V1.4 and how is it different?
Its different in the Following Ways:
I want to make the Game more visually appealing and easier to code with.
I am trying to build this game as Modular as possible and easy scalable as possible.
With the V1.3 Source Code this was not possible due to it all being written in one singular class which would be a pain the ass to work with.
So i decided to re-do the whole thing which makes it now easier to develop for and easier to work with for future Updates.

V1.4.1 Goals:

Balancing on "Boosting" when holding Shift while Moving the Spaceship.
Its currently for every Resolution 4 PX with Boost and 3 without, which will be balancing in the next Update.
Thank you guys so much for reading this and have a nice day!
