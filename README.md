Hey guys,
this is Snawa the Developer of this Bootleg Space Invaders.
This game is free and thank you for Downloading.
I would appreciate any Feedback and wishes to me for the Game.

This is Built V1.3 and currently there are following features:
Pause Menu
Highscore Saving / Loading
Resolution changing supported to following Resolutions:
- 3620 x 2036
- 2560 x 1440
- 1920 x 1080
- 1280 x 720
- 640 x 720
Also with Fullscreen support which i recommend if the following screen Resolutions are one of your current ones to avoid any weird behaviour with the Window.

I currently plan for 1.4 to be a small jump for the players due to the game being completly remade.
This games code is currently Janky as hell and every line (909 in total with many many comments) are in ONE CLASS.
So this makes it harder to code.

I will be implementing Classes so it will run better and will try to make any Resolution available and no FPS Lock which will probably not be coming out in V1.4
Im just an Amateur and this is my very first Project. 
So please dont be to harsh lol.

Anyways thank you for reading this and downloading.
This is a FREE GAME so if you bought this from somewhere you GOT SCAMMED, i am Sorry.
